# Visualization of Fourier Transform Conversion

This project provides a clear visualization of how the Fourier Transform converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. It demonstrates the core concepts, such as winding the graph and tracking the center of mass, to help visualize how the main calculations work.
